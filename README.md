#LOGIC :
   i will treat my 50 x 50 grid as a matrix so that i can increase accuracy when
  it comes to looping , i could treat it as one single table but this will cause unecessary iterations
  which must be avoided for best performance

#CREATE GRID :
  to create my grid i need 3 indicators :
     -max : the maximum width / height of our matrix
     -rowIndicator : this will be initialized to 0 , used to indicate new rows when we create our matrix in the for loop
     -colIndicator : this will be initialized to 0 , used to indicate new columns when we create our matrix in the for loop
 
#REMARK :
  good practice is always to separate  concerns , i could separate some funtions in separated files
   but for the sake of simplicity i let everything in one file

#INSTALLATION - SETUP
- clone repo into a new folder
- install vscode
- open project folder in vscode
- double click on index.html

#EDIT CODE 
- install live server package (from vscode package store )
- open project folder in vscode
- click on index.html and open it in live server.
